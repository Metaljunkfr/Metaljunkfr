ðŸ‘‹ I am Guillaume, a 32 years old developer. 

ðŸ”­ I have always been keen on screens, high-technology gadgets, video games, connected stuffs.

ðŸ‘¯:heart_eyes_cat::dancing_men: After 13 years working as a youth leader and as a High-tech customer service representative (I appreciate human contact), I have decided to retraining myself with IT development.

ðŸŒ± I am very new in this field, this is the beginning of a long story, but I love to learn new things everyday, and as in my personal life, I like to find solutions for any problem I encounter. 

ðŸ˜„ PHP and Symfony are my best friends for now (also interested in Vue.js), their documentations are well done, swap knowledges with others is also a good thing to grow up within web development. 

ðŸ’¬ For one year I have realized several projects, some are private because of sensitive informations but if you ask me, it would be a pleasure to discuss about process, code, or anything else. I am also still making 2 E-commerce projects to increase my skills. :muscle:

ðŸ“« You can find me in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaumegeorges/), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/13133575/metaljk), [My own website](https://www.guillaumegeorges.fr)
